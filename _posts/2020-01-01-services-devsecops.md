Whether you call it "DevSecOps" or "SecDevOps" the benefits of incorporating application and infrastructure security as early as possible within the software development lifecycle are undeniable.  Automating as many pieces of the continuous integration/delivery pipeline will help to lessen, if not eliminate, the impact of reactionary security compliance changes discovered late in the development lifecycle.  All of this, however, is predicated on a cultural shift favoring collaboration and agility.  This is why you need someone on your side who is familiar with various industry-standard tools which can be leveraged to gain the insight necessary to adapt to a fluid cyber security arena as well as how to drive the necessary culture change.

    I've spent the majority of my career developing web based applications in support of various
    groups within the DoD.  Most recently I've been integrating DevSecOps principles into the 
    government software development lifecycle.  I am a huge Washington Captialas fan and enjoy kayak 
    fishing.

  bio: >
    I am a graduate of Johns Hopkins University and have over twenty (20) years of 
    specialized experience in all facets of acquisition and engineering to include 
    acquiring, developing, and managing Mission Planning Software applications. 
    I have spent the majority of my career working for DCS Corporation developing 
    specialized mission planning solutions for United States Navy, Marine Corp, and 
    Air Force. While working for DCS, I served as the Chief Engineer (Systems / Software) 
    for a Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Maturity Level 3 organization 
    specializing in Agile software development.

    I co-founded Versagility Technologiges in March 2016 where I serve as the 
    President / CEO. Since this time I have been developing microservice architectures 
    and web applications providing support for both logistics and mission planning.

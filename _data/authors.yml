  bio: >
    Proud alumnus of Towson (BS) and Johns Hopkins (ME) Universities. Over 2 decades of 
    Department of Defense contract acquisition, management and engineering support. Before 
    I joined Versagility Technologies I spent 9 years as the Chief Technologist for a large company. 
    I spent most of my time advising DoD clients about the application of commercial industry best 
    practices for Information Technology and Systems Engineering to the DoD community. Now with 
    Versagility Technologies my responsibilities have not changed. They include development of organizational 
    technical strategy, business development, direct systems engineering consulting for clients, research 
    and development, staff development, training, and performing as technical advisor for high visibility 
    projects. Now with a small company, I’m enjoying every minute of the ride working alongside driven, 
    super smart folks with a singular focus… excellence. When I’m not working I enjoy watching sports, 
    taking orders from my 3 beautiful daughters and one amazing wife:-). Cheers!

    I’ve worked for the DoD for the last 7 years developing many applications using a 
    variety of tools and languages.  Some of these projects spanned from interfacing with 
    different hardware and porting projects to different languages to be more efficient.  
    In my spare time I like to build computers and I play a variety of instruments such as 
    guitar, drums, and the piano.

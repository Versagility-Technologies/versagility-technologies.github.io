  bio: >
    I've spent the majority of my career developing web based applications in support of various
    groups within the DoD.  Most recently I've been integrating DevSecOps principles into the 
    government software development lifecycle.  I am a huge Washington Captialas fan and enjoy kayak 
    fishing.

    I've spent the majority of my career developing web based applications in support of various
    groups within the DoD.  Most recently I've been integrating DevSecOps principles into the 
    government software development lifecycle.  I am a huge Washington Captialas fan and enjoy kayak 
    fishing.

  bio: >
    I am a graduate of Johns Hopkins University and have over twenty (20) years of 
    experience in all facets of acquisition and engineering to include acquiring, developing, 
    and managing software applications. I have spent the majority of my career 
    working for DCS Corporation developing specialized mission planning solutions for the
    United States Navy, Marine Corp, and Air Force. While working for DCS, I served as the Chief 
    Engineer (Systems / Software) for a Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Maturity 
    Level 3 organization specializing in Agile software development.

    I co-founded Versagility Technologiges in March 2016 where I serve as the 
    President / CEO. Since this time I have been developing microservice architectures 
    and web applications providing support for both logistics and mission planning.

    Outside of work, I am a father of three and an avid Washington D.C sports fan.
